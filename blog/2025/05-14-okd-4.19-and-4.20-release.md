We’re excited to announce that OKD 4.19.0-scos.0 has been officially promoted to the stable release channel!

You can view the release payload here: [4.19.0-okd-scos.0](https://amd64.origin.releases.ci.openshift.org/releasestream/4-scos-stable/release/4.19.0-okd-scos.0)
and compare the differences with the last stable 4.18 release.

A few significant highlights of this release include:
- Bootimages and node images are now based on Centos stream CoreOS (scos)
- Bootimages are available publicly at: https://cloud.centos.org/centos/scos/9/prod/streams/
- Baremetal installs, assisted and agent based installs work seamlessly now that bootimages have been transitioned to scos
- Upgrade edges have been added from previous stable release to the new release

Alongside this stable release, we’re also publishing a development preview of the next version: [4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.0](https://amd64.origin.releases.ci.openshift.org/releasestream/4-scos-next/release/4.20.0-okd-scos.ec.0) – now available on the 4-scos-next channel for early testing and feedback.

We encourage users and contributors to test the new releases and share feedback via the OKD community channels.
Stay tuned for more updates!
